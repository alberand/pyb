Small script to display numbers in HEX, decimal and binary formats. I tired of
googling for "hex to dec", "dec to hex" etc. This can be done by python or bash
but it's easier and doesn't force you to remember commands.

Doesn't work with negative numbers.

Usage:

    $ pyb 0b01010101
    $ pyb 0xFF
    $ pyb 123

    * Negative numbers
    * Octal number representation
    * ASCII
